Gnuplot-Iostream Interface
==========================

This interface allows gnuplot to be controlled from C++ and is designed to be
the lowest hanging fruit. In other words, if you know how gnuplot works it
should only take 30 seconds to learn this library. Basically it is just an
iostream pipe to gnuplot with some extra functions for pushing data arrays and
getting mouse clicks. Data sources include STL containers (eg. vector or map)
and one or two dimensional Blitz++ arrays (of scalars or TinyVectors). Support
for other data sources should be easy to add.

Basically there are two functions defined: send() sends arrays of data values
(it is overloaded to do the right thing based upon what type of variable you
pass) and getMouse() gets the position of a mouse click. Everything else is
accomplished by sending commands manually to gnuplot via the iostream
interface. This is in my opinion the easiest way to do it if you are already
comfortable with using gnuplot. If you would like a more abstract interface
check out the gnuplot-cpp library (http://code.google.com/p/gnuplot-cpp).
